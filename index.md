## Introduction

Welcome to the OWASP Ruhrpott Chapter, part of the [OWASP Germany](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/) network. Our chapter brings together cybersecurity professionals, application security enthusiasts, and industry experts to exchange insights, collaborate, and stay ahead in the fast-paced world of security.

No matter your background—whether you're an experienced security expert, a developer, a consultant, or just starting to explore software and application security — our community provides a space for learning and connection. Through diverse events and initiatives, we aim to cultivate an open and engaging environment where members can share knowledge, build networks, and develop their skills.

## Events 

We are running **regular Chapter meetings every 2-3 months**, mostly **in-person** at different venues in the **Ruhrpott** area. 

All individuals with an interest and enthusiasm for cyber security are warmly welcome. Our meetings are **free and open to all**, regardless of OWASP membership status. All our resources are accessible under free and open software licenses.

Feel free to refer colleagues or acquaintances to our website or individual meetings. We encourage sharing our resources to expand awareness and engagement within the community.

### Upcoming events

Stay informed about our events by joining the [OWASP Ruhrpott Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/notyetdefined) or visiting our [Upcoming Events](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-ruhrpott#div-nextevent) page.

### Agenda

Come along for an evening of good food, drinks, and great conversations while getting to know more about OWASP.

Our events often include a **guest speaker** who delves into various topics such as information security, cloud security, AI/ML security, and software security as a whole.  
Before and after the talks, attendees have plenty of time to **connect, exchange ideas, and network**.

### Past events

You can access slides from past presentations at our chapter meetings and Stammtisch events at [Past Events](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-ruhrpott/#div-pastevents).

### Interested in speaking at our events?

We welcome speakers of all levels! You don't need to be a talk pro or seasoned professional to present at one of our events. However, we do request that your talk be relevant to a security domain and offer value to attendees. To become a speaker, please review the [OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and then reach out to our chapter leads with details of your presentation.

> Please note that vendor pitches are not allowed, so please adhere to the [OWASP Speaker Agreement](https://owasp.org/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and avoid marketing stunts. Also please ensure to remove your company logos from all but one "marketing" slide.

## Ruhrpott Chapter

The OWASP Ruhrpott Stammtisch was formed in 2015 by Christian Becker, Sven Schlüter and Tim Günther. 
In 2025 the Stammtisch became an official OWASP Chapter. 

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapters Policy](/www-policy/operational/chapters). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button.
